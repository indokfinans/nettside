# Workshop at Danske Bank's Local Office

Last Thursday, InFi was invited to Danske Bank's local offices in Trondheim for the semester's first workshop!

We were delighted to meet [Ole BÃ¸-Pedersen](#) and [Torstein MjÃ¸nner](#), both from Danske Bank's Corporate Finance team in Oslo.

We were introduced to a public-to-private case via Kahoot! The members were divided into buy-side and sell-side teams, and with great guidance from Ole and Torstein, we delved into a real P2P transaction. It was both fun and educational discussions!

Finally, the whole gang went to OX Taproom for some excellent food and drinks.

InFi thanks everyone for a great event, we learned a lot! ðŸ˜„
